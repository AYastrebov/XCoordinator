‚ÄúHow does an app transition from one view controller to another?‚Äù.
This question is common and puzzling regarding iOS development. There are many answers, as every architecture has different implementation variations. Some do it from within the implementation of a view controller, while some use a router/coordinator, an object connecting view models.

To better answer the question, we are building **XCoordinator**, a navigation framework based on the **Coordinator** pattern.
It's especially useful for implementing MVVM-C, Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator:

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èGetting started

Create an enum with all of the navigation paths for a particular flow, i.e. a group of closely connected scenes. (It is up to you when to create a `Route/Coordinator`. As **our rule of thumb**, create a new `Route/Coordinator` whenever a new root view controller, e.g. a new `navigation controller` or a `tab bar controller`, is needed.)

Whereas the `Route` describes, which routes can be triggered in a flow, the `Coordinator` is responsible for the preparation of transitions based on routes being triggered. We could, therefore, prepare multiple coordinators for the same route, which differ in which transitions are executed for each route.

In the following example, we create the `HomeRoute` enum to define triggers of the main flow of our application. `HomeRoute` offers triggers to open the home screen, display users and to log out. The `HomeCoordinator` is implemented to prepare transitions for the triggered routes.

```swift
enum HomeRoute: Route {
    case home
    case users
    case logout
}

class HomeCoordinator: NavigationCoordinator<HomeRoute> {
    override func prepareTransition(for route: HomeRoute) -> NavigationTransition {
        switch route {
        case .home:
            let viewModel = HomeViewModel(router: anyRouter)
            let viewController = HomeViewController(viewModel: viewModel)
            return .push(viewController)
        case .users:
            let viewModel = UsersViewModel(router: anyRouter)
            let viewController = UsersViewController(viewModel: viewModel)
            return .push(viewController)
        case .logout:
            return .dismiss()
        }
    }
}
```

To use coordinators right from the launch of the app, make sure to create the app's window programmatically in `AppDelegate.swift` (Don't forget to remove `Main Storyboard file base name` from `Info.plist`). Then set the coordinator as the root of the window's view hierarchy in `AppDelegate.didFinishLaunching`.

```swift
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    let window: UIWindow! = UIWindow()
    let router = AppCoordinator().anyRouter

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        router.setRoot(for: window)
        return true
    }
}
```

Routes are triggered from within Coordinators or ViewModels. In the following, we describe how to trigger routes from within a ViewModel.

```swift

class HomeViewModel {
    let router: AnyRouter<HomeRoute>

    init(router: AnyRouter<HomeRoute>) {
        self.router = router
    }
    
    /* ... */
    
    func usersButtonPressed() {
        router.trigger(.users)
    }
}
```

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Extras

For more advanced use, XCoordinator offers many more customization options. We introduce custom animated transitions and deep linking. Furthermore, extensions for use in reactive programming with RxSwift are described.

### Custom Transitions

Custom animated transitions define presentation and dismissal animations. You can specify `Animation`-objects in `prepareTransition(for:)` in your coordinator for several common transitions, such as `present`, `dismiss`, `push` and `pop`. Specifying no animation results in not overriding previously set animations - Use `Animation.default` to use the default animations of UIKit.

```swift

class UsersCoordinator: NavigationCoordinator<UserRoute> {
    /* ... */
    override func prepareTransition(for route: UserRoute) -> NavigationTransition {
        switch route {
        /* ... */
        case .user(let name):
            let animation = Animation(
                presentationAnimation: YourAwesomePresentationTransitionAnimation(),
                dismissalAnimation: YourAwesomeDismissalTransitionAnimation()
            )
            let viewModel = UserViewModelImpl(coordinator: coordinator, name: name)
            let viewController = UserViewController(viewModel: viewModel)
            return .push(viewController, animation: animation)
        /* ... */
        }
    }
}
```

### Deep Linking

Deep Linking can be used to chain different routes together. In contrast to the `.multiple`-transition, deep linking can identify routers based on previous transitions (e.g. when pushing or presenting a router), which enables chaining of routes of different types. Keep in mind, that you cannot access higher-level routers anymore once you trigger a route on a lower level on the stack.

```swift
class AppCoordinator: NavigationCoordinator<AppRoute> {

    /* ... */

    override func prepareTransition(for route: AppRoute) -> NavigationTransition {
        switch route {
        /* ... */
        case .deep:
            return deepLink(.login, AppRoute.home, HomeRoute.news, HomeRoute.dismiss)
        }
    }
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è XCoordinator does not check at compile-time, whether a deep link can be executed. Rather it uses assertionFailures to inform about incorrect chaining at runtime, when it cannot find an appriopriate router for a given route. Keep this in mind when changing the structure of your app.

### RxSwift extensions

Reactive programming can be very useful to keep the state of view and model consistent in a MVVM architecture. Instead of relying on the completion handler of the `trigger` method available in any `Router`, you can also use our RxSwift-extension. In the example application, we use Actions (from the [Action](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/Action) framework) to trigger routes on certain UI events - e.g. to trigger `LoginRoute.home` in `LoginViewModel`, when the login button is tapped.

```swift
class LoginViewModelImpl: LoginViewModel, LoginViewModelInput, LoginViewModelOutput {

    private let router: AnyRouter<AppRoute>

    private lazy var loginAction = CocoaAction { [unowned self] in
        return self.router.rx.trigger(.home)
    }

    /* ... */
}

```

In addition to the above-mentioned approach, the reactive `trigger`-extension can also be used to sequence different transitions by using the `flatMap`-operator, as can be seen in the following:

```swift
let doneWithBothTransitions = 
    router.rx.trigger(.home)
        .flatMap { [unowned self] in self.router.rx.trigger(.news) }
        .map { true }
        .startWith(false)
```

## üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è Why coordinators
* **Separation of responsibilities** with the coordinator being the only component knowing anything related to the flow of your application.
* **Reusable Views and ViewModels** because they do not contain any navigation logic.
* **Less coupling between components**

* **Changeable navigation**: Each coordinator is only responsible for one component and does not need to make assumptions about its parent. It can therefore be placed wherever we want to.

> [The Coordinator](http://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/) by **Soroush Khanlou**


## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why XCoordinator
* Actual **navigation code is already written** and abstracted away.

* Clear **separation of concerns**:
  - Coordinator: Coordinates routing of a set of routes.
  - Route: Describes navigation path.
  - Transition: Describe transition type and animation to new view.
* **Reuse** coordinators, routers and transitions in different combinations.
* Full support for **custom transitions/animations**.
* Support for **embedding child views** / container views.
* Provides **observables for presentation / dismissal** of views (E.g. block button until presentation is done).
* Generic BasicCoordinator classes suitable for many use cases and therefore **less** need to write your **own coordinators**.
* Full **support** for your **own coordinator classes** conforming to our Coordinator protocol - You can also start with one of the following types to get a head start: `NavigationCoordinator`, `ViewCoordinator`, `TabBarCoordinator` and more.
* Generic AnyRouter type erasure class encapsulates all types of coordinators and routers supporting the same set of routes. Therefore you can **easily replace coordinators**.
* Use of enum for routes gives you **autocompletion** and **type safety** to perform only transition to routes supported by the coordinator.

### Components

#### üé¢ Route
Describes possible navigation paths within a flow, a collection of closely related scenes.

#### üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è Coordinator
An object loading views and creating viewModels based on triggered routes. A Coordinator creates and performs transitions to these scenes based on the data transferred via the route. In contrast to the coordinator, a router can be seen as an abstraction from that concept limited to triggering routes. Often, a Router is used to abstract away from a specific coordinator in ViewModels.

#### ‚úàÔ∏è Transition
Transitions describe the navigation from one view to another view. Transitions are available based on the type of the root view controller in use. Example: Whereas `ViewTransition` only supports basic transitions that every view controller supports, `NavigationTransition` adds navigation controller specific transitions.

#### üèó Transition Types
Describes presentation/dismissal of a view including the type of the transition and the animation used. Most often used are the following transition types:
  - present: present view controller.
  - embed: embed view controller to a container view.
  - dismiss: dismiss the view controller that was presented modally by the view controller.
  - none: does nothing to the view controller (allows you to handle case later without touching the ViewController)
  - push: push view controller to navigation stack. (only in `NavigationTransition`)
  - pop: pop the top view controller from the navigation stack and updates the display. (only in `NavigationTransition`)
  - popToRoot: pop all the view controllers on the navigation stack except the root view controller and updates the display. (only in `NavigationTransition`)
